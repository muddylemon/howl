00:00   Dylan Thomas reads his poem Do not go gentle into that night
00:05   Do not go gentle into that good night,
00:09   Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
00:14   Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
00:20   Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
00:24   Because their words had forked no lightning they
00:28   Do not go gentle into that good night.
00:32   Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
00:37   Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
00:41   Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
00:46   Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
00:51   And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
00:55   Do not go gentle into that good night.
00:59   Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
01:05   Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
01:10   Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
01:17   And you, my father, there on the sad height,
01:22   Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
01:29   Do not go gentle into that good night.
01:33   Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
