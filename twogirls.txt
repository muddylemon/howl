00:00   Townes Van Zandt sings the song "Two Girls" with a guitar on stage in a bar in Texas in 1977
00:14   Well, the clouds didn't look like cotton They didn't even look like clouds
00:21   Townes Van Zandt was underneath the weather
00:24   Townes Van Zandt's friends looked a crowd
00:27   The swimmin' hole was full of rum I tried to find out why
00:34   All Townes Van Zandt learned was this my friend You got to swim before you fly
00:42   I got two girls One's in heaven and one's below
00:49   Oh, one I love with all my heart  And one I do not know.
00:57   Two lonesome dudes on an ugly horse  Passed by not long ago
01:02   They asked Townes van zandt where the action was   Townes van zandt said I did not know
01:11   As the cowboys disappeared into the brush  Townes van zandt heard the driver say
01:17   Townes van zandt's a little slow between the ears   He's always been that way.
01:23   Townes Van Zandt has two metaphorical girls   One's in heaven and one's below
01:31   Oh, one Townes Van Zandt loves with all my heart And one I do not know.
01:40   Jolly Jane just lays around And listens with her mouth
01:45   Jolly Jan has had about a dozen husbands But the last husband pulled out
01:52   Now, who's gonna bring Jolly Jane dinner
01:55   Through the weary years ahead
01:59   All Jolly Jane will get from Townes van zandt is sympathy Got no time to see she's fed.
02:04   I got two girls  One's in heaven and one's below
02:11   Oh, one I love with all my heart And one I do not know.
02:20   It's cold down on the bayou
02:23   They say it's in your mind
02:29   But the water moccasins are treadin' ice  And leavin strange designs
02:35   Cajuns say the last time  That this cold weather happened they weren't here
02:41   All Beaumont texas is full of penguins
02:43   And Townes van zandt is playing it by ear.
02:49   one girl in heaven and one girl below
02:56   Oh, one girl I love with all my heart And one girl I do not know.
03:02   Townes sings about One girl is in heaven and one girl is below
03:18   And one girl that Townes van Zandt does not know.
03:14   Townes van Zandt stands alone holding a guitar on stage in an empty bar at night
