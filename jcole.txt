00:00 (J Cole) rapping
00:03 All hail the mighty survivor of hell
00:06 Plopped down from heaven to sell
00:07 Holy water that I scooped from the well
00:09 Fought tooth and a nail,
00:10 Just to prevail mongst it’s ruthless
00:12 As I move through the field
00:13 Feelin worried
00:14 In a hurry like a 2 minute drill
00:15 To make a couple mil Off a lucrative deal
00:17 Selling train of thought,
00:19 Name a artist who could derail
00:21 You’ll never see it like a nigga hula hoopin in jail
00:23 I got a friend smart as fuck, but he stupid as hell
00:26 He swear that God ain’t real
00:27 Since it ain’t no way to prove it his self
00:29 As if the universe ain’t enough
00:31 As if the volcanoes ain’t erupt
00:33 As if the birds don’t chirp
00:34 As if a trillion nerves don’t work in the human body Who would I be?
00:38 Without the creator of this theater Beside me to gently guide me?
00:42 Somedays I wonder if I need to pick a different hobby
00:44 I’m deep in with this rappin It’s all a nigga know
00:47 I never didn’t nothin better, it’s hard to let it go
00:49 But like a father, watching his daughter, walk down the altar,
00:52 With tears in his eyes, you gotta let her grow
00:56 And so I shall, but first I been honing my style
00:58 Coldest around, with more quotables than what the quota allows
01:01 You see a top 10 list I see a Golden Corral, nigga
01:05 As the moon jumps over the cow
01:07 I contemplate if I should wait to hand over the crown And stick around for a bit longer
01:11 I got a strange type of hunger
01:13 The more I eat the more it gets stronger, The more it gets stronger I said the more it gets stronger
01:21 j-hope
