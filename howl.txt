12:09	a yellow paper rose twisted on a wire hanger in the closet, and even that imaginary, nothing but a hopeful little bit of hallucination—
12:14	ah, Carl, while you are not safe I am not safe, and now you're really in the total animal soup of time—
12:22	and who therefore ran through the icy streets obsessed with a sudden flash of the alchemy of the use of the ellipsis catalogue a variable measure and the vibrating plane,
12:38	who dreamt and made incarnate gaps in Time & Space through images juxtaposed, 
12:48	and trapped the archangel of the soul between 2 visual images and joined the elemental verbs and set the noun and dash of consciousness together jumping with sensation of Pater Omnipotens Aeterna Deus
12:58	to recreate the syntax and measure of poor human prose and stand before you speechless and intelligent and shaking with shame, rejected yet confessing out the soul to conform to the rhythm of thought in his naked and endless head,
13:15	the madman bum and angel beat in Time, unknown, yet putting down here what might be left to say in time come after death,
